> NOTE: Microdexed-touch is capable of generating audio with a large dynamic range, the extremes of which can cause damage to loudspeakers or other components, and also to your hearing.
> Please be specially careful when activating the MultiBand Compressor. Depending on it's settings, this easily can increase the perceived output loudness by 10x or even more.<br>
> Set the volume **on your amplifier to zero** and then increase the volume in slow steps, to avoid taking any risk hurting your ears or your equipment.

## This is MicroDexed with TFT Touch Display, graphic UI and sequencer

### This build requires a Teensy 4.1,  PCM5102A Audio Board, 320x240 ILI9341 SPI Display with Capacitive Touchscreen and a PSRAM Chip for custom samples.
<p>

MicroDexed started as a Teensy based, 6-operator-FM-synthesizer. The first generation is still maintained at: [https://codeberg.org/dcoredump/MicroDexed](https://codeberg.org/dcoredump/MicroDexed)

Compared to the first generation, MicroDexed-touch offers a lot of new features/improvements:

* "Large" Graphical Interface, view and edit multiple Parameters in one Screen

* Use external MIDI gear over USB or Mini TRS Jacks (DIN MIDI with adaptor) from 2 x 16 MIDI Channels in the Sequencer

* Map MIDI CC to external MIDI Devices to control Input/Parameters

* Global plate reverb, 2 global delay effects (500ms, with added PSRAM chip 60 seconds or even more)

* Loading, playing and editing multi-sampled instruments or layered instruments in a "live" mode or played by the sequencer. Auto detection sample zones but also can be edited manually. This is early work in progress and currently not stable when using pitch shifting and polyphony

* 2 instances of "Virtual Analog" Monosynths with one OSC, PWM, Multimode Filter and Noise. A lot of useful new sound possibilities.

* 8 voice polyphonic Oscillator, based on the code of Mutable Instruments - Braids. No wavetables but added individual envelopes and multimode filters for all voices
 
* Much improved Sequencer with 8 Tracks, 16 Step Patterns, 16 Step Pattern Chains, up to 16384 Song Steps, Arpeggiator with 1/8 - 1/64 Steps, Arp Patterns including Euclidean settings, Pitched Drum- and Instrument Sample playback

* The sequencer can also play chords of various types, stacked up to 7 notes, using only a single sequencer track

* In addition to the chain based Sequencer there is second sequencing tool: LIVE SEQUENCER

* LIVE SEQUENCER offers 12 tracks for recording up to 4 patterns each, including a Song mode with pattern muting

* Both sequencers do work together and are fully synced

* Global Mixer View with all Channels

* Multiband Master Compressor with 4 bands

* Sample Management from SD-CARD and PSRAM, samples can be loaded from SD-CARD to PSRAM during runtime.

* Touch Mute Matrix for live / realtime performance

* Tracker View (Editor) - work in progress

* Track Print/Recording - work in progress

* Remote control in web-based 1:1 UI with added features (filemanager,filetransfer, screenshots etc.) Work in progress - connected to PC via Teensy MicroUSB Connector

## Buttons / Encoders

A quick guide how the push Encoders are working:

Encoder left will be referred to as ENC_L and encoder right will be referred to as ENC_R.

[SHORT PUSH] means a simple, momentary push on the encoder.

[LONG PUSH] means a push and hold down of the encoder for about 2 seconds.

Usually [SHORT PUSH] ENC_L brings you back to the main menu or closer to the main menu one step.

Usually [SHORT PUSH] ENC_R selects or confirms an input/menu item/goes deeper into this item.

In microsynth and in dexed voice page, [LONG PUSH] ENC_R, switches between the 2 Instances.

In Menus that need 2 Encoders for naviation, ENC_R controls Y movement and ENC_L controls X movement (for example in Song mode)

[LONG PUSH] ENC_L starts and stops the sequencer in most pages.
